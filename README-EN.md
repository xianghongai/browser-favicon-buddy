## Usage

2. Launch **favicon-buddy**, load the bookmark file, click **Start Processing** and wait for it to finish.

## Notes

Chrome bookmark import:

- It can be *very* slow and unresponsive â€” please be patient.

Firefox bookmark import:

- The **Bookmarks Toolbar** will be imported into **Bookmarks Menu**. Select all entries and move them back to **Bookmarks Toolbar** if desired.
- Items that originally lived in **Bookmarks Menu** will be appended, which may cause stored *Keywords* to be lost.
